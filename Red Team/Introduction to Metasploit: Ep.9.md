##### **Images:**
To add images to your walkthrough, you'll need to upload the image to your repository or link to an external image.

**Uploading an Image:**
1. Click on the **`Add file`** button in GitHub, and select **`Upload files`**.
2. Upload your image file (e.g., `recon_image.png` or `exploit_image.jpg`) to the **Red Team** folder.

After uploading the image, use the Markdown image syntax to embed it in your file. For example:

```markdown

![Nmap Scan Results](../Uploads/SYSTEM.png)
