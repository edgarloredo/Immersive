Identifying malware is integral to understanding threats and avoiding infection; Yara is capable of scanning malicious files, designed specifically for this purpose. This series will expand on how to use Yara effectively and create rules to analyze malware samples and identify threats.

Hint
String sets
When creating the condition for the Yara rule there is some standard syntax we can use to match groups.

rule ExampleRule

{

strings:

$a = "bar"

$a2 = "foo"

$a3 = "cow"

$b = "hello"

$b2 = "enterprise"

$c = "world"

condition:

1 of them // equivalent to 1 of ($*)

}

- all of them | this will match files that have all of the strings
- any of them | this will match files that have at least one of the strings
- all of ($a*) | this will match files that have all of the strings in $a, $a2 and $a3
- any of ($b*) | this will match files that have any of the strings in $b and $b2

There are many ways you can analyze a malware sample to create effective and efficient Yara rules. **The goal is to create Yara rules specific enough for the Yara engine to match malicious files but not to match legitimate files**. This can be a difficult, time-consuming process for the researcher unless they know how to quickly search for meaningful data inside various files. Below are various commands you can use to aid in this process.

1. strings <file_name>
2. xxd <file_name>
3. cat <file_name>
4. cat <second_malicious_file> | grep <string_from_first_malicious_file>
